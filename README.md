# Pneumatic-Hand-Glove
This repository contains all the files from our summer research project at IIT Gandhinagar. In coherence with the given problem statement "POC/Prototyping of Pneumatic Hand Glove for Finger Joint Rehabilitation" under the guidance of Prof. Aniruddh Mali, I, along with my project partners Khyatee Kakadiya, Aindrila Kundu and Sakshi Anand plan to develop a pneumatic hand glove prototype to assist in finger joint rehabilitation for stroke patients. This repository includes all the necessary materials and documents that contributed to the creation of our final prototype.
